# Portfolio Application

This is a Portfolio website that introduces a developer to future employers and other colleagues in the field. It enables a developer to show their expertise through a portfolio of work that is easily accessible by links. The Contact opens a quick line of communication so that there is no delay or lost email addresses. The contact form includes error messages to the user so they understand how to fix their contact form submission.
